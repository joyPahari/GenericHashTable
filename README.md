# Generic HashTable with collision handling by AVL Tree.
## CDAC-ADS Mini Project <br />
This is completely a JAVA based project which can be easily downloaded and run in the JAVA console itself.


We have implemented Generic HashTable excpeting Integer, string or Double type of "values" and which handels collisions of key(Integer type) through Chaining.
* Chaining  is Implemented by AVL Tree.


## Basic Project Flow

### Functionalities Implemented (Internally calling AVLTree)
* Add in HashTable
* Search in HashTable
* Display elements of HashTable
* Remove elements from HashTable

## AVL Tree
AVL Tree is height balanced tree which auto-balances by Tree Rotation. <br />
All 4 rotations are implemented in ```AVLTree<T>.java```, here T represents Generic Type.
